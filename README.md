# MZObjectController

MZObjectController manages KVO on a content object, providing delegate
notification on various changes to the attributes of the content object. Very
loosely inspired by NSObjectController and NSFetchedResultsController

## Usage

Usage is straightforward; see the header files for method details.

## Requirements

MZObjectController requires ARC (this is not a strict requirement. If you need
non-ARC compatibility, please open an issue).
